      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
I am an enthusiastic and dedicated web developer with a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly websites. Currently, I am gaining valuable experience as a data science intern at Technopark, honing my skills in the realm of data analytics and visualization.

Excitingly, I am set to embark on a new journey as an intern at CITI Pune next year, where I look forward to further expanding my knowledge and expertise in the field of technology. My love for coding goes beyond mere lines of text; it's a constant drive to explore new horizons and learn cutting-edge technologies.
<br/>
I strongly believe in the power of technology to make a positive change in the world. With every line of code I write, my aim is to contribute meaningfully, whether it's by developing innovative solutions, creating seamless user experiences, or leveraging data for informed decision-making. I am dedicated to staying updated with the latest advancements in the tech industry, as I believe that continuous learning is the key to making a difference in our rapidly evolving digital landscape.
<br/>
Let's code a better future together! üíªüåç
